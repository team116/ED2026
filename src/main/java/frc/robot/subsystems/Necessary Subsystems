Subsystems necessary for development:

1. Drivetrain subsystem (Base off of last year's design)

2. Shooter Mechanism
3. Intake/Outtake Mechanism
4. Deployer Mechanism
// Deployer of the intake/outtake
5. Climber
6. Feeder Mechanism
// Internal conveyor system for shooter

Draft requirements for subsystems and what components are necessary
Communicate any non-existent sensing systems to build team / Tomas

Split up software members based on developing different mechanisms
(2 per group if necessary)

Possible:

7. AprilTag Sensors (possible camera vision, or object detection)
8. Loader System, possibly a part of others
9. Hood System

Possibly make larger subsystem for applying feeder, loader, and shooter


Required Components/Abilities:

Shooter Subsystem:
2 Motors for Shooter axle
PIDF controlling, with variable shooting power

Loader Subsystem:
1 Motor, going in both direction. Variable speed currently unnecessary.
Possible vision sensor for "stuck" fuel.

Feeder Subsystem:
1 Motor, run in (likely) both directions and possible variable speed.

Deployer Subsystem:
1 Motor, run in both directions, possible PIDF development (or variable speed).
Ask for 2 limit switches.

Intake/Outtake:
1 Motor, run in both directions, definite PIDF, variable speeds.
Possible vision-based sensor for detecting in-motion fuel.

Climber Subsystem:
No exact design yet.
Variable speed running, omnidirectional running.
Touch Sensor / Limit Switch for detecting extended climber hook.
Possibly limit switches for folding of climbing system. (CHECK WITH GUY)

AprilTag Subsystem:
2 limelights
